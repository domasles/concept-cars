„Just. Wow.“ - my first thought just looking at GT-R's prototype.

#### Why am I so surprised?

I'm just amazed by the courage of Nissan. Even I couldn't have thought that 2001's Nissan concept would make it to the real world.

#### How it started vs. How it ended

Nissan made the GT-R prototype really close to what it is today, but maybe slightly more edged and, well, „Concept-looking.“ Nobody really thought that this would or *will* be a real car anytime soon, as cars in 2001 (what I'm calling, the „Round car era“) were pretty different to what was presented in the Tokyo Motor Show. Fast-forward to 2007, and there we have it!

#### The car we all love (...now)

Nissan has gained a lot of reputation with its first GT-R, that they carried through to today. Of course, the 2007 GT-R (AKA. GT-R r35) has seen some updates, but they weren't as close to how it has changed from its prototype.

#### GT-R's meaning to racing world

The Nissan GT-R has also made a significant impact in the world of motorsports. It has participated in various racing series and events, including the prestigious Nürburgring 24-hour race, where it has achieved notable success.

#### My thoughts

I can't rate this „Dream to real“ thing less than 4 stars. I'm not a true fan of the design of this car (I think the r34 (predecessor of this model) looks more... Authentic), but that's just my personal opinion. Overall, it has generated loads of excitement among car lovers and I cannot describe it anything else than „A miracle nobody thought of.“
