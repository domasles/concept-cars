The masterpiece that has never got a chance to shine.

#### Let's talk about the concept!

##### What do we know:

When we look at the concept (Toyota FT-1), it becomes clear that it was meant to be the new Supra. Let's see:

It was like a mix of previous Toyota cars that „exploded“ in popularity, but with a new fashion added to it. Although, fans weren't happy with this new design.\
When we dig deeper, it turns out that Toyota, once again shared the development with another brand. This time it was BMW.
The all-new Supra was powered by two different turbocharged 2.0 litre four-cylinder, or a turbo 3.0 litre inline six-cylinder engines by BMW. All motors were equipped with an eight-speed automatic gearbox.

#### Why do I think it failed

To put it simply: the *fanbase*. Mk5 Toyota Supra doesn't have the same *hype* and *feel of nostalgia* that mk4 Supra had. I can't even understand this, but, we've got our proof. And it's all over the internet.

#### Not for everyone

Let's talk more about the kind of *toxic* fanbase of Toyota Supra models. After the massive success of mk4 Supra, the fanbase were expecting either no more cars in this lineup, or either a banger, that would blow everyone's minds away. For me it did. For the rest of the community, it did not.\
You see, it's a very personal thing for cars. Many people had their hopes too high, that even this masterpiece couldn't deliver. Many people were just looking at this car on the outside, and didn't look under the hood. It's often sad to see such cars being underrated.

#### Better than you think

If you'd dig deeper, you'd really start seeing the sleeping monster in it. As a stock car, it can produce more horsepower than its predecessor, it's more aerodynamic, it's generally newer and made with new technologies to help reach Supra's potencial. Fans just don't appreciate it as much.

#### Last part

It was, is and will be one of the best cars Toyota made that didn't get a chance to shine. For me, I knew this is is going to be something big the first time I saw the concept and the rumors of an all-new Supra car. I really like the design and transformation from a concept to a car. Let's face that FT-1 (the concept) looks better in every way, but we have what we have. Overall, it's a great car that I will have to rate at 5 stars with the hope of it being more appreciated among the community.
