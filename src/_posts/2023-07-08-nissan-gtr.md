„The car that made it. And blew my mind.“ Is the first thing I think when I look at transformation between the concept and mass-production versions of GT-R.

#### How to use?

It's actually really simple! Add the rating in your YAML front matter. It also supports halfs:

```html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <b>
            <a href="fdfg">fdfg</a>
            </b>
            </body>
