Another Škoda's concept port. I bet you won't believe it.

#### Another concept

I know I've said this in the [**Enyaq**]({{ site.github.url }}/skoda-enyaq) post, I'll say it again: „You know what I mean if you've ever looked up „Škoda concept cars“ on the internet.“ As of now, I can't think of a car manufacturer with more concept cars than Škoda.

#### No wonder this is the best selling Škoda!

Superb originated from the Vision C, which already looked like a real product that was already done. This shouldn't have even been a concept car at all! Why is the Superb the most selling Škoda so far? Let's see:
1. It's practical. It has much space for all the family needs.
2. Has good design. Ask anyone on the street - they'll tell you the same.
3. Comfortable. This varies between modifications, but the Superb is oriented to being a luxury product with its own priviledges.

#### This is a great deal

When 3rd gen Superb got its looks from the Vision C, it determined the 3rd gen of Škoda's cars. „It was the upgrade we needed.“ Just compare it to 2nd gen Superb (disgusting!). Jumping out of that, yes, it's a long car, so probably not the most maneuverable or sports-oriented, but still pretty fast with its **231 km/h** top speed. Top speed of the concept is unknown. Looking to the 2 we can also see slightly different headlights and other minor details that have changed, but overall, a pretty similar look. Again, I love Škoda's design, but as I've said in previous posts, I think a port from a concept to a product should be should be something real big. As it turns out, Superb was a great deal that originated from a stable and production-ready prototype.

#### Škoda's way of doing things

As you can see, Škoda likes to make a lot of concepts, that already are functional products. That's why we can't expect much more out of a concept car port from Škoda.

#### The part you've been waiting for

I will give this transformation a 4 star rating. The 2 things that led to this are:
1. Superb's commercial success.
2. Update throughout generations.

I don't know what else to say. Great car, great rating.
