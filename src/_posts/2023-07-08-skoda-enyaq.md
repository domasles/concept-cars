It's no secret that Škoda based many cars off of concept ones. This is no exception.

#### „What do you mean?“

You know what I mean if you've ever looked up "Škoda concept cars" on the internet. A great example of it would be [**Vision C**]({{ site.github.url }}/skoda-superb), which later became the Superb. This is no exception, because once again, what was Škoda's focus, later became more real than someone imagined.

#### SUVs?

I've always imagined Škoda as a cheaper brand with sedans and hatchbacks in its menu. Never thought that Škoda would start to make SUVs, but I guess the Yeti was a clear sign I never noticed. But becides that, I really like Škoda's direction and focus they're going for. Result - Vision iV becoming the Enyaq. Not the first, not the least in Škoda's SUV lineup.

#### Comparison

As you can see above, both of the cars look really simmilar. It's a good thing, because Škoda had a stable platform to build the Enyaq on. It was like a copy-paste of the design, which by the way, I really love. I can't say the same about the specs, because they shouldn't be accurate for a concept of a car.

#### Downsides

Enyaq has delivered slightly less futuristic design than the Vision iV, unlike the other manufacturers' cars (like Tesla with the Cybertruck) who try *everything* to make their cars look straight out of year 2050 or so. This Škoda's design choice isn't a bad thing, because when I look at some of the cars, I think: „That's a little bit too much.“ But I like the concept look of this car *more* than the working model. Still, a pretty cool electric SUV, that I **would** mind taking a look at when buying a new car. „If it fits the needs, there is nothing to worry about“

#### Final words

I will rate this car at 3.5 stars. It wasn't the same as its concept, with some slight downsides, but on the other hand, a nice hop on to the electric SUVs market. Here also comes Škoda's style to make concept and mass-production variants almost the same, and I'm expecting a car to make more of a jump when being ported to a real and buyable product.
