## Introduction

Hello. I'm Domas, lead developer of this website. I'm very interested in cars and that's why this is all about cars.

## How this idea started

I grew up with movies like [**Fast and Furious**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious) and games like [**Need for Speed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed), which formed my understanding of what cars are. I've had this idea for a lot of time, but only now I started to develop it.

## How my development journey started

My family members were familiar to computers, so I thought it was a good idea for me to start programming, as I could get help very easily and get this as fast/high quality as possible.
