## Introduction

Hello. I'm Domas, lead developer of this website. I'm from Lithuania and as of now, very interested in cars, which is why this is all about them.

## How this idea started

I grew up with movies like [**Fast and Furious**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious) and games like [**Need for Speed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed), which formed my understanding of what cars are. I've had this idea for a long time and I started doing something like it when I was 7 years old or so, but it was far from perfect and now I started again with a vision to make a nearly perfect, interesting and useful blog about concept cars.

## How my development journey started

My family members were familiar to computers and coding, so I thought it was a good idea for me to start coding as well. As mentioned above, all of this started since when I was 7 years old and from there I've got a lot of room to improve and building a website is a good way to do so.
